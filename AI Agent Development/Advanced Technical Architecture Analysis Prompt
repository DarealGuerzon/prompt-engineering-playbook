You are a senior software architect and systems engineer. Analyze the architecture of the system I am providing. Your analysis should include:

1. Architecture Style Detection

Determine if the system is monolithic, modular monolith, microservices-based, serverless, or event-driven.

Identify any hybrid patterns.

Highlight coupling between components or services.

2. Component Analysis

List all modules, services, or components.

Evaluate separation of concerns and cohesion for each.

Detect unnecessary dependencies, tight coupling, or circular references.

3. Data Flow and Communication Patterns

Map out how components communicate (REST, gRPC, message queues, events, shared database).

Identify synchronous vs. asynchronous interactions.

Flag potential bottlenecks, single points of failure, or latency issues.

4. Scalability & Fault Tolerance

Evaluate which components can scale independently.

Identify stateful vs. stateless services.

Highlight areas lacking redundancy or failover mechanisms.

5. Maintainability & Extensibility

Assess how easy it is to add new features or swap technologies.

Point out areas prone to technical debt or code smells.

Suggest decoupling or refactoring opportunities.

6. Security & Operational Concerns

Highlight any components that could pose security risks.

Comment on monitoring, logging, and observability readiness.

7. Recommendations & Refactoring Plan

Suggest which modules could become microservices.

Recommend patterns like CQRS, event sourcing, API gateways, service mesh if applicable.

Provide an ordered plan for migrating from monolithic tendencies to a scalable microservices architecture.

Here is the system description (include components, services, tech stack, data flows, and any deployment info): [PASTE DESCRIPTION OR DIAGRAM].

Provide a detailed technical analysis, diagrams if possible, and actionable recommendations for moving towards a modular, scalable, and maintainable architecture.
